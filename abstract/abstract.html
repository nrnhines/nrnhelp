     NEURON is a nerve simulation program which is designed
to solve two kinds of problems: 1) where cable properties of
cells play an important role, possibly including
extracellular potential close to the membrane, and 2) where
cell membrane properties are complex, involving many
ion-specific channels and ion accumulation. 
<P>
    NEURON is designed around the notion of continuous cable
"sections" which are connected together to form any kind of
branched cable and which are endowed with properties which
vary continuously with position along the section.  The
design goal is to keep entirely separate the physical
properties of the neuron from the numerical issue of size of
spatial compartments. 
<P>
     User defined membrane properties are described by
expressing models in terms of kinetic schemes and sets of
simultaneous equations.  Membrane voltage and states are
computed efficiently by compiling these model descriptions
and using an implicit integration method optimized for
branched structures. 
<P>
     NEURON realizes a tremendous degree of flexibility by
using an object oriented interpreter to setup the physical
properties of the cables, define the appearance of the
graphical interface, control the simulation, and plot the
results.  The default graphical interface is suitable for
initial exploratory simulations, setting parameters, common
control of voltage and current stimuli, and graphing
variables as a function of time and position.
