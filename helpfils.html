Note: NEURON has undergone many revisions since the Reference Manual was written, 
mostly to add new features 
or make existing ones easier to use or more efficient.  
Only rarely have these changes "broken" anything.
If you find anything in these files that
is seriously at variance with the current version of NEURON, 
please check the more recent documents.  
We would also appreciate it if you could 
bring such items to our attention, so we can correct them.
