<title>Hoc - A User Extendable Interactive Language </title>
<h1> Hoc </h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
	Hoc (I pronounce it "hoak") is based on the floating point
calculator developed in 'The
Unix Programming Environment' by Kernighan & Pike (Prentice-Hall
Software Series, 1984).  Appendix 2 of that book contains a Hoc manual
for their limited version and Chapter 8 describes Hoc's development and
design philosophy.  Hoc has a C like syntax and is very similar to the
'bc' calculator.  Considerable extensions have been made to the basic
version of hoc, both in added functions and additions to the syntax.
Also, the user can build his
<a href=ps/ocfig1.ps>own</a> hoc interpreter, incorporating special
functions and variables which can be called and accessed interactively.
<p>
Hoc has an object oriented syntax addition which can be used
to implement abstract data types, encapsulation of data, and polymorphism (but no
inheritance). Most programs written using version 2
of NEURON
will work correctly in version 3. The neuron3 version  of the interpreter
is called
OC (pronounced oak) but we will only use that name when describing things
that are different or a superset of what is available in Hoc.
See $NEURONHOME/lib/help/oc.help for a brief synopsis of each command
and function. See ivoc.help for information about
graphical interface objects and functions. nrnoc.help and nrniv.help
respectively contain information about neuron specific syntax/functions
and neuron specific graphical interface objects. Other help files
in $NEURONHOME/lib/help are devoted to miscellaneous objects (eg a vector
class and random number class).

<h2> The interpreter in $NEURONHOME/bin/$CPU </h2>
The HOC interpreter has served as the general I/O module in many kinds of
applications and as such is directly executed under many different names.
The <a href=ps/ocfig2.ps>figure</a> illustrates some non-neural examples
of hoc's use in different domains.

The simplest interface between HOC and domain specific problems
consist of a set of functions and variables that are callable from hoc.
This was the level of implementation of the the original
<a href="ref/cable.html"> CABLE </a> program (NEURON version 1).
NEURON version 2 departed from this uniform interface style by introducing
neuron specific syntax into the interpreter itself. This was meant to
allow the user to
specify neuron properties at a level of discourse more appropriate to
neurons and help relieve the confusion and reduce the mental energy
required to constantly
shift between high level neural concepts and their low level representation
on the computer. NEURON version 3, by introducing object syntax allows
much better structuring of the conceptual pieces that are assembled to
build a simulation.
<p>
When NEURON is installed, four programs are constructed from the combinations
of whether or not the C++ graphical interface is included with the interpreter;
and whether or not neuron specific syntax is included.
<dl>

<dt>oc<dd> The bare interpreter. No gui, no neuron specific functions. The
source code for the interpreter is found in $NEURONHOME/oc/SRC.

<dt>nrnoc<dd> Analogous to version 2 of neuron but the interpreter is oc.
Neuron specific c code is located in nrnoc/SRC.

<dt>ivoc<dd> OC with C++ classes and graphical interface (which is written
in C++. This is the best starting place for building non-neural applications.
These C++ classes are implemented in ivoc/SRC. The files here are of general
use apart from the neuron simulation domain and generally implement the
graphical interface, eg. Graph, xpanel, VBox, etc. However the File, List,
Vector, and Random class are very useful even if no window manager is
present.

<dt>nrniv<dd> Version 3 of NEURON. Contains additional C++ classes for
a neuron specific interface, eg Shape, and other built-in classes which
are more conveniently written in C++ than C, eg. Impedance which makes use
of the gnu library's Complex class. The C++ source
is located in nrniv/SRC/.
This is
the usual starting point for building special versions with
user defined mechanisms
via the model description language.

<dt>neuron<dd> Really a special version of nrniv but something ought to
be called "neuron" and it has to be in a place where it does not
conflict with version 2's main executable, also called neuron.
It is the demonstration version which contains
extra membrane mechanisms defined in $NEURONHOME/demo/release. The
neuron executable for version 3 is located in the demo directory and is
run by the "neurondemo" script.

<dt>neuron.exe (mswindows version)<dd> Same as the unix version of nrniv but
is capable of dynamically loading model descriptions compiled with the
gcc compiler. (see <a href="#mknrndll"> mknrndll </a>)
</dl>

<h2> Constructing programs that contain the interpreter </h2>
There are various shell scripts for unix workstations
in $NEURONHOME/bin that ease the task
of incorporating the interpreter into user applications.
<dl>
<dt>nrnivmodl<dd>
The workhorse
for creating special versions of neuron with user defined membrane
properties.
<pre>
	nrnivmodl file1 file2 ...
</pre>
adds the model descriptions defined in file1.mod, file2.mod, etc. to nrniv.
The resulting executable is called special. If no file arguments are
present then nrnivmodl adds all the files in the current working directory
that have the suffix .mod to the program called special. In order to
construct an executable, the model descriptions first have to be translated
into c with the nocmodl translator. Such models must contain a NEURON
block which specifies the type of model (density mechanism or point process),
the names of ions it uses, and which variables are to be treated as
range variables in the interface to OC.


<a name="mknrndll"><dt>mknrndll<dd></a>
The mswindows version of nrnivmodl. Instead of creating a new executable
it compiles and links the models into a dynamically loadable library called
nrnmech.dll. Neuron.exe automatically looks in the current working directory
for a nrnmech.dll file and if it exists, loads it into memory and makes the
mechanisms available to the interpreter. More than one dll file can be loaded
by listing them after the -dll argument to neuron.exe when it is run.

<dt>ivmodl<dd>
<pre>
	ivmodl file
</pre>
adds the model description defined in file.mod to ivoc. The resulting
executable is called "file". Since the model is not in a neuron context
it must be self-contained. All variables and functions defined in the
model are available to the interpreter. The model description
translator used is ocmodl. These kinds of models don't necessarily have
anything to do with neurons.

<dt>makeiv<dd>
<pre>
	makeiv name file1.o file2.o ...
</pre>
creates a version of ivoc called "name". name.h is an include file which
declares in regular C syntax the variables and functions
that are to be accessible from OC. C files for the corresponding objects
contain the definitions of these functions and variables. The script
compiles the files, translates name.h into a interface specification file
that makes sense to the interpreter and links the proper libraries to
make the executable. I very rarely use this style anymore since it is
usually easier to use the model description language and nrniv even for
non-neural problems and there is a growing set of general use interpreter
classes which depend only incidentally on the existence of a section.
Almost anything can be treated as a point process and then handled by the
interpreter as an object.

<dt>nrnocmodl, ocmodl, makeoc<dd> Same as their counterparts above but
the C++ libraries are not included in the resulting executable program.
</dt>

<h2> The stand-alone interpreter </h2>
The rest of this chapter describes the general aspects of the interpreter
which are common to all applications that contain it. Although for concreteness
we use nrniv or neuron.exe,  all the examples
and fragments can be typed to any program, eg. oc, that contains the
interpreter.

<h2> Starting the interpreter </h2>
Hoc is started by typing the program name in a terminal
window.
<pre>
	nrniv
	nrniv [filenames] [-]
</pre>
When there are no filename arguments, Hoc takes its commands 
from the standard input and
prints its results on the standard output. With filename arguments, the
files are read in turn and the commands executed.  After the last file
is executed, hoc exits. A '-' as a filename, signals that commands are
to be taken from the standard input until an EOF (^D in UNIX,
'^Z return' in DOS ). One can also exit by executing the "quit()" expression.
<p>
When starting hoc with arguments it is
easy to forget the final '-' and be surprised when the program quickly
exits, perhaps after putting graphs on the screen. Generally the '-'
is left off only when running the interpreter in batch mode under control
of a shell script.
<p> The mswindows version, neuron.exe, does not exit if the trailing '-'
is left out. This makes it more convenient to attach neuron.exe to .hoc files
so one can merely click on the file name in a file manager. Also, neuron.exe
starts a terminal window (derived from winio from "Undocumented Windows" by
Andrew Schulman) to which one can type hoc commands.
Neuron.exe does not support exiting by ^D or ^Z. Instead one can
exit by typing quit(), choose "Close" from the title bar, or choose "Exit"
from the winio File menu.
<p>
On startup, neuron prints a banner showing the current version and
last change date.

oc>
</pre>
The "oc>" prompt at the beginning of a line means the interpreter
is waiting for you to type a command.

<h2> Error handling </h2>
This is one of many areas where oc falls short. Oc is a good I/O
facility but a bad general purpose language. Debugging large programs in
OC is difficult and it is best to keep things short.
<p>
Oc is implemented as a stack machine and this means that commands are
first parsed into a more efficient stack machine representation and
subsequently the stack machine is interpreted.
<p>
Errors during compilation are called parse errors and range from
invalid syntax:
<pre>
oc>1++1
parse error
nrniv: parse error near line 3
1++1
     ^
oc>
</pre>
to the use of undefined names:
<pre>
oc>print x[5], "hello"
nrniv: x not an array variable near line 9
print x[5], "hello"
           ^
</pre>
These kinds of errors are usually easy to fix since they stop the parser
immediately and the error message, which always refers to a symptom,
generally points to the cause. Error messages specify the current line
number of the file being interpreted and print the line along with
a carat pointing to the location where the parser failed (usually one
or two tokens from the mistake).
<p>
Errors during interpretation of the stack machine are called run-time
errors:
<pre>
oc>sqrt(-1)
sqrt: DOMAIN error
nrniv: sqrt argument out of domain near line 5
sqrt(-1)
         ^

</pre>
These errors usually occur within a function and the error message
prints the call chain:
<pre>
oc>proc p() {execute("sqrt(-1)")}
oc>p()
sqrt: DOMAIN error
nrniv: sqrt argument out of domain near line 8
{sqrt(-1)}
           ^
        execute("sqrt(-1)")
      p()
nrniv: execute error: sqrt(-1) near line 8
^
oc>
</pre>
Unfortunately there is no trace facility to help debug run-time errors
and the line number refers to the latest command instead of the location
of the offending statement.
<p>
	Interpretation of a hoc program may be interrupted with one or
two ^C's typed at the terminal. Generally, one ^C is preferred because
while the interpreter is busy it will wait til it
reaches a safe place (won't be in the
middle of updating an internal data structure) before it halts and waits
for further input. Two situations may necessitate the second ^C.
If the program is waiting inside a system call, eg. waiting for console
input. If the program is executing a compiled function that is
taking so long  that program control doesn't reach a known
safe place in a reasonable time.
If the interpreter is in an infinite loop, as in:
<pre>
oc>while(1) {}
</pre>
a single ^C will stop it
<pre>
^Cnrniv: interrupted near line 2
while(1) {}

oc>
</pre>
<p>
	Long expressions may be continued on succeeding lines by using a
backslash character `\' as the last character in the line.  Quoted
strings continued in this way have a limit of 256 characters and the
newlines appear in the string as though `\n' was used.

<h1>Syntax</h1>

<h2>Names</h2>

	A name is a string of less than 100 alphanumeric characters or '_'
starting with an alpha character. Names must not conflict with Keywords
or built-in functions.  Names are global except when the 'local'
declaration is used to create a local scalar within a procedure or
function. Or unless the name is declared within a template (class).
A user created  name can be associated with a

<pre>
	global scalar	(available to all procedures/functions)
	local scalar	(created/destroyed on procedure entry/exit)
	array
	string
	template (class or type)
	object reference
</pre>

The following lists the keywords, built-in constants, and built in functions
of the oc interpreter.
The last group
of keywords are reserved for NEURON syntax. The authoritative list is in
$NEURONHOME/oc/SRC/hoc_init.c. Following these are lists of function and
variable names introduced by nrnoc. The authoritative list here is in
$NEURONHOME/nrnoc/SRC/neuron.h but note that mechanism types and variables
do not appear here or any other single place
(see $NEURONHOME/nrnoc/SRC/(*.mod capac.c extcell.c)
Last listed are the built-in classes
(templates) of ivoc and nrniv. Even if this document becomes out of date one
can find all these names in
$NEURONNHOME/(ivoc/SRC/oc_classes.h nrniv/SRC/nrn_classes.h)

kept up to date but this file tends to lag behind the current version.
        
<h2>Variables</h2>

	Double precision variables are defined when a name is assigned a
value in an assignment expression.  For example, 
<pre>
var = 2 
</pre>
Such scalars are available to all interpreted procedures and functions.
There are several built-in variables which should be treated as
constants:

<pre>
	FARADAY		coulombs/mole
	R		molar gas constant, joules/mole/deg-K
	DEG		180 / PI	degrees per radian
	E+		base of natural logarithms
	GAMMA		Euler constant
	PHI		golden ratio
	PI		circular transcendental number
	float_epsilon	resolution for logical comparisons and int()
</pre>

<p>
	Arbitrarily dimensioned arrays are declared with the 'double'
keyword. For example, 
<pre>
double vector[10], array[5][6], cube[first][second][third] 
</pre>
Array elements are initialized to 0.0. Array indices, of course, are
truncated to integers and run from 0 to the declared value minus 1.
When an array name is used without its indices, indices of 0 are assumed.
<p>
Arrays can be dynamically re-dimensioned within procedures.

<p>
	String variables are declared with the 'strdef' keyword.  For
example, 
<pre>
strdef st1, st2 
</pre>
Assignments are made to string variables as in, 
<pre>
st1 = "this is a string" 
</pre>
String variables may be used in any context which requires a string, but
no operations, such as addition of strings, are available (but see
sprint function).

<p>
	After a name is defined as a string or array, it cannot be
changed to another type.  The double and strdef keywords can
appear within a compound statement and are useful for throwing away
previous data and reallocating space. However the names  must be originally
declared at the top level before re-defining in a procedure.

<h2>Expressions</h2>

	The arithmetic result of an expression is immediately typed on
the standard output unless the expression is embedded in a statement or
is an assignment expression. Thus, 
<pre>
2*5 
</pre>
typed at the keyboard, prints
<pre>
	10 
</pre>
and, 
<pre>
sqrt(4) 
</pre>
yields
<pre>
	2 
</pre>
The operators used in expressions are, in order of precedence from high
to low,

<pre>
	()
	^	exponentiation  (right to left precedence)
	- !	unaryminus, not
	* / %	multiplication, division, ``remainder''
	+ -	plus, minus
	> >= < <= != ==	  logical operators
	&&	logical AND
	||	logical OR
	=	assignment (right to left precedence)
</pre>

Logical expressions have value 1.0 (TRUE) and 0.0 (FALSE).
The remainder, a%b, is in the range, 0 <= a%b < b, and
can be thought of as the value that results from repeatedly
subtracting or adding b until result is in the range.  This differs from
the C syntax in which (-1)%5 = -1. For us, (-1)%5 = 4.

<p>
Logical comparisons of real values are inherently ambiguous due to
roundoff error. Roundoff can also be a problem when computing integers from
reals and indices for vectors. For this reason the built-in global variable
<tt>float_epsilon</tt> is used for logical comparisons and computing vector indices.
In what follows, the constant e denotes  float_epsilon.
The default value is 1e-11 but can be set by the user.
<pre>
	hoc		math or c equivalent\\
	x == y		-e <= x - y <= e
	x < y		x < y - e
	x <= y		x <= y + e
	x != y		x < y - e or x > y + e
	x > y		x > y + e
	x >= y		x >= y - e
	int(x)		(int)(x + e)
	a[x]		a[(int)(x = e)]
</pre>


<h1>Statements</h1>
	A statement terminated with a newline is immediately executed. A
group of statements separated with newlines or white space and enclosed
in {} form a compound statement which is not executed till the closing
<pre>
}
</pre>
is typed.  Statements typed interactively do not produce a value.  An
assignment is parsed by default as a statement rather than an
expression, so assignments typed interactively do not print their value.
Note, though, the expression, 
<pre>
(a = 4) 
</pre>
would print the value,
<pre>
	4 
</pre>
An expression is treated as a statement when it is within a compound statement.

<h1>Control Flow</h1>

	In the syntax below, stmt stands for either a simple statement or a
compound statement.
<pre>
	if (expr) stmt
	if (expr) stmt1 else stmt2
	while (expr) stmt
	for (expr1; expr2; expr3) stmt
	for var = expr1, expr2   stmt
	for iterator_name(...) stmt
</pre>
In the <tt>if</tt> statement, stmt is executed only if expr evaluates
to a non-zero value. The <tt>else</tt> form of the <tt>if</tt> statement executes
stmt1 when expr evaluates to a non-zero (TRUE) value and stmt2
otherwise.
<p>
The <tt>while</tt> statement is a looping construct which repeatedly
executes stmt as long as expr is TRUE. The expr is evaluated
prior to each execution of stmt so if the expr starts as 0, the stmt
will not be executed even once.
<p>
The general form of the >tt>for</tt> statement is executed as follows:
The first expr is evaluated. As
long as the second expr is true the stmt is executed.  After each
execution of the stmt, the third expr is evaluated.
<p>
The short form of the for statement is similar to the do loop of fortran
and is often more convenient to type.
It is, however, very restrictive
in that the increment can only be unity. If expr2 is less than expr1
the stmt will not be executed even once.  Also the expressions are
evaluated once at the beginning of the for loop and not reevaluated.
<p>
The iterator form of the for statement is an object oriented iterative
construct which separates the idea of iteration over a set of items from
the idea of what work is to be performed on each item. As such it is
most useful when dealing with objects which are collections of other
objects. It doesn't add any power to the language (neither does the
for i=1,10 form) but it is useful whenever the iteration over a set of
items has a nontrivial mapping to a sequence of numbers and is used many times.
As a concrete example consider the definition of an iterator called "case"
<pre>
	iterator case() {local i
		for i = $2, numarg()-1 {
			$&1 = $i
			iterator_statement
		}
	}
</pre>
Now it is easy to use this iterator to loop over small sets of unrelated
integers as in (suppose x has already been used as a scalar variable)
<pre>
	for case(&x, 1, -1, 3, 25, -3) print x
</pre>
The alternative would be the relatively tedious:
<pre>
	double num[5]
	num[0] = 1
	num[1] = -1
	num[2] = 3
	num[3] = 25
	num[4] = -3
	for i = 0, 4 {
		x = num[i]
		print x
	}
</pre>

The following statements are used to modify the normal flow of control.
<pre>
break		Exit from the enclosing while or for loop.
continue	Jump to end of stmt of the enclosing while or for.
return		Exit from the enclosing procedure.
return expr	Exit from the enclosing function.
stop		Exit to the top level of the interpreter.
quit()		Exit from the interpreter.
</pre>

<h1>Functions and Procedures</h1>

The definition syntax is
<pre>	proc name() {stmt}</pre>
Procedures do not return a value.
<pre>	func name() {stmt} </pre>
Functions must return via a
<pre>	return expr </pre>
statement.
<p>
Arguments are denoted, $1, $2, etc. within the body of a function
or procedure. Scalars, strings, and objects can be passed to functions
and procedures. A string argument is denoted $s1, An object argument is
denoted $o1. The variable, `i', may be used in place of the positional constant
to denote which argument is to be retrieved. eg. $i<br>
Formally, an argument starts with the letter `$' followed by an optional
`&' to refer to a scalar pointer, followed by an optional `s' or `o' to refer
to string or object reference, followed by an integer or the variable `i'.

<p>
As a trivial example of a function definition, consider: 
<pre>
func f(){
     return $1 * $1 
} 
</pre>
This defines the function <tt> f(arg1)</tt> which
returns the square of its argument.
User defined functions can be used in any expression.

<p>
Functions can be called recursively. For example, the factorial
function, can be defined as 
<pre>
func fac(){
     if ($1 == 0) {
           return 1
     } else {
          return fac($1-1)*$1
     } 
} 
</pre>
and the call 
<pre>
fac(3) 
</pre>
would produce 
<pre>
	6 
</pre>
It would be a user error to call this function with a negative argument or
non-integer argument. Besides the fact that the algorithm is numerical nonsense
for those values, the function would never return since the recursive
argument would never be 0. Actually after some time the stack frame list
would overflow and an error message would be printed as in:
<pre>
	oc>fac(-1)
	nrnoc: fac call nested too deeply near line 10
	fac(-1)	
	        ^
	        fac(-99)
	      fac(-98)
	    fac(-97)
	  fac(-96)
	and others
	oc>
</pre>
<p>
Notice the recommended placement of {} in the above function. The
opening `{' must appear on the same line as the statement to which it is a
part. The closing `}' is free form but clarity is best served if it is
placed directly under the beginning of the statement it closes and interior
statements are indented.  Local variables maintained on a stack
can be defined with the "local" statement.  The "local" statement must be
the first statement in the function and on the same line as the "proc"
statement.  For example, 
<pre>
proc squares(){	local i, j, k /* print squares up to arg */
     for (i=1; i <= $1; i=i+1) print i*i 
} 
</pre>
This insures that any previously defined global variables
with the names, i, j, or k
are not affected by the
procedure. Notice text between /* and */ is treated as a comment.
Also, comments to the end of the line may be started by the double slash
as in
<pre>

<h1>Input and Output</h1>

The following describes simple text based input and output. User interaction
is better performed using the graphical interface and if dealing with multiple
files one must use the File class.;
<p>
	Standard hoc supplied a read and print statement, whose use can
best be seen from the example, 
<pre>
while (read(x)) {
     print "value is ", x
} 
</pre>
The return value of <tt>read()</tt> is 1 if a value was read, and 0 if there was an
error or end of file.  The print statement takes a comma separated list
of arguments which may be strings or variables. A newline is printed at
the end. "read" and "print" use the standard input and output respectively.

<p>
	For greater flexibility the following builtin functions are
available:
<p>
<tt>printf("format string", arg1, arg2, ...)</tt><br>
Printf is compatible
with the standard C library function, allowing f, g, d, o, and x formats
for scalar arguments, and the s format for strings.  All the %
specifications for field width apply.
<p>
<tt> fprint("format string", arg1, arg2, ...)</tt><br>
Fprintf is the
same as the printf function except that the output goes to the file
opened with the wopen("filename") function.
Files opened with the wopen
function are closed with  <tt>wopen()</tt> with no arguments or wopen("").
When
no write file is open, fprintf defaults to the standard output.  Wopen
returns a 0 on failure of the attempted open.
<p>
<tt>sprint(strdef, "format string", arg1, ...)</tt><br>
This function is very useful in building filenames
out of other variables.  For example, if data files are names dthis.1,
dthis.2, dthat.1, dthat.2, etc., then the names can be generated with
variables in the following fashion.
<pre>
strdef file, prefix
prefix = "this"
num = 1
sprint(file, "d%s.%d", prefix, num)
</pre>
After execution of these statements the string variable, file, contains
<tt> dthis.1</tt>
<p>
<tt>fscan()</tt><br>
Fscan returns the value read sequentially from
the file opened by <tt>ropen("filename")</tt>.
The file is closed with <tt>ropen()</tt> or by a call to
<tt>ropen</tt> with another filename.  "ropen" returns a 0 if the file
could not be
opened. If no read file is open, <tt>scanf</tt> takes its input from the standard
input. 

<p>
Read files must consist of whitespace or newline separated numbers in
any meaningful format.  An EOF will interrupt the program with an error
message.  The user can avoid this with a sentinel value as the last
number in the file or by knowing how many times to call scanf.
<p>
<tt>getstr(strvar)</tt><br>
Getstr reads the next line from the file opened with ropen and assigns it
to the string variable argument.  The trailing newline is part of the string.
<p>
<tt>xred("prompt", default, min, max)</tt><br>
Xred is a useful
function which places a prompt on the standard error device along with
the default value and waits for input on the standard input.  If a
newline is typed "xred" returns the default value.  If a number is typed,
it is checked to see if it is in the range defined by min and max.  If
so, the input value is returned.  If the value to be returned is not in
the range, the user is prompted again for a number within the proper
range.
<p>
<tt> xopen("filename")</tt><br>
The file is read in and executed by hoc.
This is useful for loading previously written procedures and functions
that were left out of the command line during hoc invocation.

<h1>Editing</h1>

	The '<tt>em</tt>' command invokes a public domain emacs editor (not to be
confused with the EMACS with Lisp like syntax). I still like it but
it is definitely showing its age in this day of mouse editors.
Many people are already very comfortable with their own editor and find it more
convenient to create a file and transfer it into hoc with the xopen command.
<p>
The `em' editor is normally
in the insert mode and control keys are used as commands to the editor.
Invocation is instantaneous with the cursor located where
emacs was last exited.  The relevant commands involving the interaction
between emacs and hoc are: 
<dl>
<dt>^C<dd>	Return to hoc. The current edit buffer is read into hoc
		and executed.  A syntax error will return to emacs with
		the cursor at the line where the parser failed.
		Final exit from hoc (\V+^D+) will prompt for each unsaved
		buffer.

<dt>^X^F<dd>	Prompts for a filename to read into a new buffer with
		the name of the filename.  The editor moves to the new
		buffer.

<dt>^XB<dd>	Prompts for a buffer name or number.  The editor moves
		to that buffer.

<dt>^X^B<dd>	Lists the buffers. Use \V+^X1+ to clear the buffer list window.

<dt>^X^R<dd>	Prompts for a filename and replaces the contents of the
		current buffer with the contents of the file.

<dt>^X^S<dd>	Updates the current filename with the contents of the
		current buffer.

<dt>^X^W<dd>	Prompts for a filename and writes the current buffer to
		that name. 
</dl>
Note that ^C only executes a buffer. It does not save any unsaved
buffer. On exit from hoc you will be prompted for each unsaved buffer
whether or not to save it.

<p>
HINT: Break large programs into many files and edit them in separate buffers.
Buffers larger than 100 lines take a noticeable time to interpret. 
Use an init.hoc file consisting of xopen("filename") commands to setup
the environment and run with "hoc init.hoc -".  Then edit only the
files you need to change in that run.
