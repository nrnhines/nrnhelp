<title>Object Oriented Programming in OC</title>
<h1>Object Oriented Programming in OC</h1>
<p>
In OC, an object is a collection of functions, procedures, and data; the
data defines the state of the object.  OC has just enough extra syntax
to support a subset of the object oriented programming paradigm. 
A subset, because all it really does is support information hiding and has
no support for <a href=#inheritance>inheritance or polymorphism</a>.
Nevertheless, it offers
greatly increased ability to maintain conceptual control of the entire
program.  It immediately gives one all the power of data structures of
languages such as C or Pascal and most of the power of modules. 
<p>
Objects in OC can be thought of as a kind of abstact data type that is
very useful in separating the idea of what a thing does from the details
of the way it goes about doing it.  OC language support for objects came
late to the neuron system --- after the notion of cable sections --- and
as a consequence there are several types (eg.  sections, mechanisms,
range variables) of variables that are clearly treated as objects from a
conceptual point of view but grew up without a uniform syntax.  Object
orientation is in many ways a natural style of programming whose
techniques are re-invented constantly by every programmer
<a href=#coplein>(Coplein, 92)</a>.  The object
notation consolidates these techniques so that much of the tedious
programming necessary to use them is automatically handled by the
interpreter. 
<h2> Object vs. Class</h2>
<p>
Let's first get straight the distinction between object and class. 
You're close to the mark if you think of a class as a cookie cutter that
cuts out objects called cookies.  The class is a general type whereas an
object of the class is a specific instance of the type. The idea of a
class as a template motivated the keyword that signals the definition
of classes in OC --- one surrounds a collection of functions,
procedures, and variables with the keywords, begintemplate and
endtemplate. 
<p>
From the user's point of view it is necessary to discuss how to create
and destroy objects; what is an object variable; how to call an object's
methods or access its data; and how to pass objects to functions.  From
the programmer's point of view it is necessary to discuss how to define
a class. We'll give a general overview first before plunging into details.

<h2> OC Object Model</h2>
The object model used by OC manipulates references to objects and
<a href=#objrefnever>never</a>
the objects themselves.  That is, object variables
or references are equivalent to pointers.  The reference can be
considered to be a label or alias for the object.  Thus assignment
<pre>
	ob1 = ob2
</pre>
means that ob1 refers to the same object referred to by ob2 and NOT that
a new object is cloned from ob2 and pointed to by ob1. Thus if
the ob2's object contains a variable called "data" and that value is
changed by the statement:
<pre>
	ob2.data = 5
</pre>
Then
<pre>
	ob1.data
</pre>
will print the value
<pre>
	5
</pre>
It quickly becomes tedious to always talk about ``the object referred to by
xxx'' and we often shorten the phrase to ``xxx'' always keeping in the
back of our minds that xxx is only one of possibly many labels for the
object it points to. For the next few paragraphs we'll strictly maintain
the distinction between object reference and object but be aware that we
don't always maintain such discipline.

<h2>Objects and object variables</h2>

<h2>Declaring an object variable</h2>
Just as it is often convenient to deal with variables that can take on different
number values (algebra is more powerful than arithmetic), it is often
convenient to deal with object variables which can refer to different
objects at different times. One declares object variables with
<pre>
	objectvar name1, name2, name3, ...
</pre>
One can use objref in place of the objectvar keyword. They are synonyms.
The objref keyword does have the advantage of being easier to type and it
is a bit more explicit with regard to the pointer nature of object variables.

<h2>Creating an object</h2>
One creates an object with the <code> new </code> keyword. Thus
<pre>
	objectvar g[3]
	for i=0,2 { g[i] = new Graph() }
</pre>
creates 3 graph objects, g[0], g[1], g[2], using
the Graph template. We'll talk about where the templates come from
later.

Executing these two statements will create three graph windows on the
screen.

<h2>Using an object variable</h2>
The object variable, g[2],
should be thought of as pointing to an actual object located in the computer.
This object has hidden variables that describe its state along with
visible variables, functions and procedures that do things to itself and to
the outside world.  The syntax for using the visible components of an object
uses a ``dot'' notation reminiscent of how one accesses a structure element
in C. E.g.
<pre>
	g[1].erase()
</pre>
although, in C, since the object variable is really a pointer one would
use the arrow notation, ``a->b''. In C++, the object variable is more
akin to a reference variable.

The Graph class is a built-in template with a large number of functions
available for constructing x-y graphs.
<pre>
	g[2].size(0,1,0,10)
	g[2].xaxis()
</pre>
defines a model coordinate system  and draws an axis in the third graph
window.

<h1>Defining an object template</h1>
The syntax for object templates is
<pre>
	begintemplate name
	public name1, name2, name3, ...
	external function1, function2, function3, ...
		... hoc code ...
	endtemplate name
</pre>
With very few exceptions the hoc code can be anything you like but
generally consists of declarations of variables and definitions of
procedures, and functions.
Outside the template you cannot refer to any variable or functions except
those listed in the public statement.
Inside the template you cannot refer to any user externally
defined global variables or functions except those that appear in the
external statement.
You can execute built-in functions such as printf(), and exp().
You can also create objects from any externally defined template.

Even very simple templates have their uses. There is no such thing in
OC as an array of strings. But consider:
<pre>
begintemplate String
   public s
   strdef s
endtemplate String
</pre>
Now one can use arrays of objects to get the functionality of arrays of
strings.
<pre>
	objref s[3]
	for i=0,2 s[i] = new String()	//they all start out empty
	s[0].s = "hello"
	s[2].s = "goodbye"
</pre>

It is important to realize that
there is no conflict between the use of s as a strdef inside the template
and the use of s as an object variable outside the template.
<p>
Direct commands are executed once when the template is interpreted. This
means that declarations such as double, strdef, \func,
xopen(file), etc. that need to be executed only once and not for each
object are useful as direct commands; but direct statements such as
a=5 are less useful since a is declared but the value is lost
when an actual object is created since this statement is not executed
at that time.  To initialize variables to values other than 0. You
need to declare a proc init() procedure. This procedure will be executed
automatically everytime a new object is created.  If init() appears in
the public list, you can execute it explicitly as well.
<p>
Suppose you have a hoc file that used to work
perfectly all by itself (when nothing
else was loaded) and did something meaningful when you typed \V+run()+
Lets also suppose the file has no direct commands except declarations.
(Otherwise collect them in an init() procedure).
Then, if you put the following lines at the beginning of the file
<pre>
begin_template F1
public run
</pre>
and the following line at the end of the file
<pre>
end_template F1
</pre>
then you have an object template. You can create an object and run it with
<pre>
objectvar f1
f1 = new(F1)
f1.run()
</pre>
and you will get identical behavior as before.
What's been gained? Well, you can do this to a bunch of files and load them
all together and never worry about variable or function name clashes between
files because nothing (except the object templates and specific object names)
are global.
<p>
All variables used by
the template probably should be declared with direct assignment statements
in an init() procedure
in order to give them good default values.
It is possible to declare a variable with an assignment statement in procedure,
P1,
and then use it in a public procedure, P2, but be careful
of the case when the user executes
P2 before executing P1. In that case, the variable will have a value 0.
<p>
All variables that are not explicitly initialized in an init() procedure start
off with a value of 0.
<p>
An object inside the machine is destroyed when no object variable points to it.

<h1>Examples</h1>
<h2>Stack of objects</h2>
<pre>
begin_template Stack
   public push, pop

   objref list

   proc init() {
      list = new List()
   }

   procedure push() {
      list.append($o1)
   }

   procedure pop() {local cnt
      cnt = list.count()
      if (cnt == 0) {
         print "stack underflow"
         stop
      }
      $o1 =  list.object(cnt-1)
      list.remove(cnt-1)
   }
</pre>
Creating a stack with
<pre>
objref stack
stack = new Stack()
</pre>
initializes the stack by implicitly calling the init procedure which
merely creates an empty list for use by the push and pop procedures.

stack.push(g[1]) adds a reference to the second Graph at the end of the list.
stack.pop(g[2]) would cause g[2] to reference the same object as g[1]
and remove it from the stack.
uses List.count to find the object at the end of the list
and removes the reference from the list. 
<p>
Every object has a default print command which merely prints the objects
template name. Every object has a template name which is a string that
can be printed with  \V+print obvar.template_name+. Note that this is
equivalent (in the default case) to \V+obvar.print+.  The developer of
the Stack template would have to decide if she wanted the stack.print
to print just "Stack", or all the object template names on the stack,
or the objects themselves (with their individual print functions).

<h1>Implementation Notes</h1>
This section explains some implementation details
that may help the
user understand why some rarely used coding styles may work strangely.
<p>
Hoc began life as a stack machine. That is, the code the user writes
is interpreted into intermediate code that looks somewhat like FORTH
or Postscript languages.  The intermediate code executes a lot faster since
one is not dealing with the ascii text the user typed. When the user executes
a+b, hoc looks up the addresses of a and b once in a symbol table
at translation time. At execution time, the addresses are known.
What is relevant here is that there was only one symbol table that contained
ALL names including keywords, built-in functions, and user defined names.
Problems you will have with the OOP extension can probably be traced back
to the distinction between what is done at translation vs what is done
at execution. (Actually, these problems always existed in normal hoc as well
and consisted of failing to notify translated code that something had changed).
<p>
The OOP extension involved separating out the keywords and built-in functions
(everything that is linked with hoc) into a primary symbol table that is
always looked at first. This symbol table is fixed and doesn't get any names
added to it. Every template creates a
private symbol table which
contains every name referenced in the
template that was not a
built-in name.  This symbol table is fixed by the template in
the sense that the only way it can be changed is to re-interpret the
entire template.  This differs from the top level in which the user can
add a new name at any time and it persists forever or until it is
explicitly removed with the ``delete'' command. On re-interpreting
a template, the private symbol table is thrown away.
Then, all objects created with the old template are destroyed and
all objectvar's referring to these objects are changed to 0 (NULL).
All code is searched to find objectvar's that use
public components and the pointers to these components are updated.
If the public interface has changed so that the component no longer exists
then an error message replaces that call.
The user will have to find the
code for the function and re-interpret it.
This means that if the interface doesn't change it is not necessary to
re-interpret any code that uses the objects created by the template.
If the interface does change then all code that used the previous interface
must be re-interpreted to avoid the error messages.
<p>
There is only one list of code for a function defined by a template
and it is shared by all the objects created from the template.
Likewise for the symbol table.
<p>
There is a separate copy of the data (implicitly declared by the template)
for each object. In old HOC, the symbol table entries for variables
pointed directly to the value of the data. Obviously this won't work for
objects. There is one variable name, but its value is different for
different objects.  The solution is to change variable data pointers
to pointers into an object space. Ie. they are relative to the start of
the object data.

<h1>Caveats</h1>
If you change a template's public interface you must re-interpret all the
code that uses objects that refer to the template.
	
<h1>FootNotes</h1>

<h2><a name=inheritance>Inheritance and Polymorphism</a></h2>
Inheritance allows one to
define many kinds of subclasses starting from a more abstract
base class.
Polymorphism allows the computer to choose the right thing to do when
a function is called on the base class.
<p>
The classic example
is a drawing program that manages a list of objects of type "shape".
Shape is a base class for a bunch of particular types of shape: lines,
rectangles, circles, etc.
<p>
 For example a circle is defined as a particular kind of shape
and so is a square. All shapes have a position and that is managed by the
base class but different kinds of shapes requre different methods for
drawing the shape.
<p>
Inheritance is most effective when the subtype "IS A"
kind of base type. That is, whenever a program uses the an object of the
base type then it would also make sense if it used an object of the subtype.
Without this relationship, Polymorphism is usually not possible.
<p>
People often use inheritance when the IS A relationship does not hold in order
to conveniently reuse a portion of the base class. When one class is "ALMOST
LIKE" another and that other is ready and waiting to be used
it is tempting to inherit the whole behavior and replace only the parts that are
different. It's best to avoid this practice and instead factor out the
behavior common to both classes and place it in a base class that can be
inherited by both classes.
<p>
When inheritance captures the "IS A" relationship then Polymorphism is
possible.
<p>
OC has no direct support for inheritance.
It can only be (tediously) implemented by having the subclass instance
create its "superclass" during initialization and supply stub methods
for calling the methods of the superclass.
<p>
<h2><a name=coplein>Coplein</a></h2>
To begin learning
C++ you can start with any of a myriad of introductory books.  But you
should end with Coplein's <b>Advanced C++ Programming; styles and
idioms</b>.
<p>
<h2><a name=objrefnever>Well, almost never.</a></h2>
An object
does have a unique name that can be used anywhere a reference to the
object is used.  But that feature is for the use of the graphical
interface and should <a href:#objrefnever2>never</a> be used in programming. 
<p>
<h2><a name=objrefnever2> Never. This time I really mean it.</a></h2>
Object names or id's are not guaranteed to be the same between different
sessions of NEURON unless the sequence of creation and destruction of
objects of the same type are identical. The object name is defined as
classname[index] where the index is automatically incremented everytime
one is created. Indexes are not reused after objects are deleted except
when there are no existing objects of that type; then the index starts
over again at 0. Why are they allowed at all? It's due to a fairly
confusing sequence of considerations.
<p>
Because some objects
such as the PointProcessManager should be destroyed when their window
is dismissed.  This could not happen if the interpreter had an objref
to that object since objects are destroyed only when the reference count
goes to 0. Thus the idiom is to cause the window itself to
increment the reference count for the object
method for VBox (and decrement it when the
window is dismissed, see VBox.ref).
Now the hoc objref that holds the reference can safely discard it and
the object will not be immediately destroyed. But the consequence is that
there is
now no way to get to the object (or the objects it created)
from the interpreter except to use the object name. eg. there is no
other way to graph one of PointProcess variables in the PointProcessManager.
