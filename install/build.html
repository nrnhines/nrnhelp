<h1> Building NEURON </h1>

<h2> Non-graphical interface part </h2>
Execute the shell script:
<pre>
	InstallNRNOC
</pre>
This builds the non-graphical interface portion of NEURON (c code).
All the messages
during the build process are saved in nrnocworld. If everything worked
there will be an executable created in bin/$CPU called nrnoc.
Also there should be a libmesch... and libcvode.. in lib/$(CPU)

<h2> Graphical interface part</h2>
Execute the shell script:
<pre>
	InstallNRNIV
</pre>
If successful you will end up with an executable called nrniv.
If the NEURONHOME environment variable is set, it can be tested with
<pre>
	cd $NEURONHOME/demo
	$NEURONHOME/bin/$CPU/nrniv demo.hoc
</pre>
but you won't be able to run the release demo since the necessary
membrane mechanisms are not installed in nrniv.
To test the full release mechanism part of the demo run
<pre>
neurondemo
</pre>
