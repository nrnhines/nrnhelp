<H1>How to serve NEURON simulation files to others</H1>
<p>
I assume you already have a working http server.
<p>
In the server configuration directory there is a mime.types file.
It needs the addtional two lines:
<p>
<pre>
application/neuron               hoc nrn nrnzip
</pre>
<p>

<h2> Packaging a simulation in a .nrnzip file</h2>
<p>
It is merely a zip file with the extension .nrnzip and must
contain all the .mod, .hoc, and .session files necessary to build and
run the simulation in a single directory.
You can assume a complete installation of neuron on
the client machine including stdrun.hoc in $NEURONHOME/lib/hoc.
There must be a mosinit.hoc file which will be the argument to nrniv
(or "special" if there are .mod files).

<p>
There should be no absolute pathnames in the .nrntar file.
Every file needed should
be in the directory (and subdirectories) where the tar file was made.
In the simplest case it should be sufficient to say:
<p>
<pre>
zip sim.nrnzip *.mod *.hoc *.ses
</pre>
