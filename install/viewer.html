<TITLE>NEURON as a mosaic viewer</TITLE>
<H1>Running NEURON simulations from mosaic</H1>

<H2> Simple, one file simulations. </h2>
<p>
When you download a simulation file with a .hoc extension you can
automatically run it, ie., NEURON will run in a new xterm window and execute
the .hoc file. When you quit the simulation ((control)d in the xterm window)
the xterm will go away.

<p>
Warning: There is no security with this feature since .hoc files can
execute arbitrary shell scripts. If you do not install it you can always
download the file into some name, examine it, and then execute it explicitly
with NEURON.

<p>
You need to edit two files in your home directory: .mime.types and .mailcap <br>

<p>
Add the following lines to $HOME/.mime.types <br>
<pre>
application/neuron	hoc
</pre>

<p>
Add the following lines to $HOME/.mailcap <br>
<pre>
application/neuron; mos2nrn %s
</pre>

The mos2nrn script is found in $NEURONHOME/bin
