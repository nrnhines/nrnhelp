<TITLE>NEURON as a mosaic/netscape viewer</TITLE>
<H1>Installation for NETSCAPE under MSWINDOWS</H1>


When you download a simulation file with a .hoc or .nrnzip extension you can
automatically run it by putting the following lines in the netscape.ini file:
<pre>
[Suffixes]
application/neuron=hoc,nrn
[Viewers]
application/neuron=D:\NRN\BIN\MOS2NRN.EXE
TYPE0=application/neuron
<pre>

or else set the same thing up from within netscape using
options/preferences/helper_applications from the main netscape panel.
<p>
Warning: There is no security with this feature since .hoc files can
execute arbitrary shell scripts. If you do not install it you can always
download the file into some name, examine it, and then execute it explicitly
with NEURON.
