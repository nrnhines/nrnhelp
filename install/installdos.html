<h1> NEURON Installation on PC under DOS </h1>
This is a 32 bit program that uses the free D.J.Delorie dos extender and
gcc compiler. I am not encouraging the use of this program since it has
no graphical interface and was only hacked together to have a pc version
before the mswindows version was available. However it does have the advantage
of using only free software (the mswindows neuron.exe is compiled using
Borland 4.5 and I do not have permission to distribute the InterViews sources)
so it can be built from the sources.
