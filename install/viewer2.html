<TITLE>NEURON as a mosaic viewer for complex simulations</TITLE>
<H1>Running complex NEURON simulations from mosaic</H1>
<p>
Research level simulations generally can't be encapsulated in a single hoc
file. They may require special model descriptions of membrane channels that
have to be translated into c, compiled, and linked with the standard neuron
libraries in order to construct a special executable.
The interpreter code that runs these simulations
may be packaged in separate .hoc files for setup of neuron geometry,
specification of membrane properties, and control of the simulation.
There may be several .session files which place panels of controls and graphs
on the screen in an arrangement convenient for this simulation. Possibly there
are data files for fitting the model.
<p>
When you download a simulation file with a .nrnzip extension you can
automatically run it. The .nrnzip file is a compressed archive file containing
all the files required for the simulation. The name of the downloaded zip
file is passed to the mos2nrn shell script which is located in
$NEURONHOME/bin. This script extracts the files of the zip file, creates
a special version of neuron if required, and runs it.

To install this feature you need to edit two files in your
home directory: .mime.types and .mailcap <br>

<p>
Add the following lines to $HOME/.mime.types <br>
<pre>
application/neuron	hoc nrn nrnzip
</pre>

<p>
Add the following lines to $HOME/.mailcap <br>
<pre>
application/neuron; mos2nrn %s
</pre>

<p>
If this feature is installed and your neuron installation is working
properly then you will be able to see a propagated action potential
by <a href="hhcable.nrnzip">running
hhcable.nrnzip</a>. Also, after running that, the hhcable.nrnzip environment
can be used by subsequent hoc files to run a variation of the larger
simulation. eg. A <a href="hhcable1.hoc">changeing diameter simulation</a>
will download hhcable1.hoc and run it in the directory created by the above
hhcable.nrnzip file.

<h2><a name="warning"> Warning: No security... </a></h2>
There is no security with this feature since .hoc files can
execute arbitrary shell scripts. Also, it is not clear at this time
what kinds of bad things can happen if inadvertent errors occur.
If you do not install it you can always
download the file into some name, examine it, and then execute it explicitly
with NEURON. To aid in this process, the special.mosaic file does not work
silently but asks the user at key points whether to continue. At these
points the user may hit the return key to continue or else type n (return)
to abort the simulation. These points are: <br>

<ol>
<li>The script tells the name of the downloaded .nrntar file and the name of
the directory into which the .nrntar file will be extracted. I don't think
anything can go wrong here.

<li>The script shows a listing of the names of the files in the .nrntar file.
None of these should have absolute pathnames. All files should be extracted
into a temporary directory.
<p>
Before answering the next question here is your opportunity to inspect the
files that have been extracted.
<p>
<li>If .mod files are a part of the simulation the script will ask if you wish
to build the special version of neuron. This step may take some time.

<li>The script asks if you now wish to execute the simulation.

<li>After quitting the simulation, the script asks if you wish to clean up.
Here, the default is no.
This involves removing the directory and all subdirectories that have been
created due to extraction of the tar file and creation of the special
executable. This is the step I am most worried about since it involves
a recursive remove command "rm -r -f $simdir". If $simdir is properly
expanded in the prompt then I guess it is safe.
<li> Hit return to quit the xterm. The xterm was started with a scrollbar
so you can see all the script messages before before throwing them away.
