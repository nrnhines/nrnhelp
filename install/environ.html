<title>Environment for NEURON</title>

<h1>Update your Environment</h1>
NEURON makes heavy use of its installation location to find scripts, libraries,
and other things it needs and it tries to find them using the environment
variables NEURONHOME and CPU.

Set the NEURONHOME environment variable to the directory you extracted
the NEURON tar files into. For illustrative purposes I assume you did this
in /usr/local/neuron
and that that is your current working directory.

Set the CPU environment variable to the name that results when you
execute
<pre>
make CPU
</pre>
For illustrative purposes call it SUN4.

If your shell is the a c-shell add the following to your .cshrc file.
<pre>
setenv NEURONHOME /usr/local/neuron
setenv CPU SUN4
set path=($path $NEURONHOME/bin $NEURONHOME/bin/$CPU interviews_path/bin/${CPU})
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$NEURONHOME/bin/${CPU}:interviews_path/lib/${CPU}
</pre>
These changes will take effect immediately if you execute:
<pre>
source $home/.cshrc
</pre>

For other shells the info to add is the same -- only the syntax differs.
