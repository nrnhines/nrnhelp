From source code...

NEURON is divided into two compressed tar files.

The first, nrnoc...tar.Z, contains the source for the interpreter,
neuron specific equation solvers, model desription language, and built-in
microemacs editor.  All the code here is written in the c language. 
The only requirement for building this portion is bison. 

The second, nrniv...tar.Z, contains the graphical user interface. This code
is written in C++ and makes use of the C++ graphics library called
InterViews. The requirements for building this portion are InterViews and
a C++ compiler.
